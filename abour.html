    <h4>ABOUT US</h4>
     
    <p>
        WE HAVE TRIED TO MAKE A PORTAL WHERE WE CAN PROVIDE ALL THE GOVERNMENT/PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIPS . 
THERE ARE A LOT OF SCHOLARSHIPS AVAILABLE BUT DUE TO VARIOUS REASONS EX- LACK OF AWARENESS , NOT GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHOLARSHIPS AT RIGHT TIME ETC. WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEMS THROUGH OUR WEBSITE WHERE WE WILL BE PROVIDING ALL THE SCHOLARSHIPS AND THE DETAILS ALSO. WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE FILTERING OPTIONS FOR USERS WHO CAN FILTER THE SCHOLARSHIPS AS PER THEIR NEEDS. THE SCHOLARSHIPS GIVE A MORAL SUPPORT OTHER THAN FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND IT ALSO REFLECTS IN THE VARIOUS RESEARCHS ALSO. IT WILL BE MUCH BENEFICIAL FOR THE STUDENT AND THEY CAN GET GOVT. SCHOLARSHIPS LIKE NSP, ONGC, AND VARIOUS OTHER STATE SCHOLARSHIPS AND ALSO PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIPS LIKE VAHINI, FFE. WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE FACILITY FOR GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIPS PROVIDER CAN ALSO UPLOAD THEIR SCHOLARSHIPS THERE. WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE NOTIFICATIONS TO THE USERS  WHEN ANY MATCHING SCHOLARSHIPS WILL COME. WE CAN ALSO HELP THE STUDENTS BY STEP TO STEP GUIDE ALSO.
